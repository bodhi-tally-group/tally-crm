# TypeScript & React Conventions

## General
- Use functional components and hooks.
- Prefer `interface` for object shapes; use `type` for unions/utility types.
- Avoid `any`; use `unknown` and narrow, or proper types.

## React
- Colocate component-specific logic in the same file or a sibling hook/file when it grows.
- Use existing UI primitives under `components/` and `components/ui/` (Button, Input, Dialog, shadcn components) rather than reinventing.

## Imports
- Use `@/` for project imports: `import { Button } from '@/components/Button/Button'` or `import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'`.
- Group: external packages first, then `@/` imports, then relative only when necessary.
